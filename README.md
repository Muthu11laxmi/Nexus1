The UX Design is about Google class room.
Using figma tools.
The project included user research, wireframing, and prototyping to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. 
I created a responsive, visually appealing layout that highlights key services, case studies, and contact options,
improving user engagement and conversion rates.
